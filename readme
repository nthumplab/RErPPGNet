To generate the Aug-rPPG dataset, we use all the 76 training videos and the corresponding PPG signals from UBFC-rPPG and PURE datasets as the inputs to the proposed RErPPG-Net. 
The 76 input videos are from 42 subjects, where 35 subjects are from UBFC-rPPG training set and 7 subjects are from PURE training set. 
By running every possible combination of the videos and PPG signals, we generate 5776 videos of resolution 200*200 pixels. Note that, because we only include the facial region of 200*200 pixels in the data augmentation, our generated videos are of the same quality as the two benchmark datasets.
